# v1.0.0-alpha
## Expected features
- An user can access the application either as a DM or as a player: as DM, the user can create maps, place and move any placeholder pieces, and share the maps with the players; as a player, the user can access the maps shared with them by DMs, and control their respective placeholder pieces on the grid
- At the map creation step, the DM can choose a height and a width, and with that they can generate a base grid for the map to be drawn
- When a grid is created, all squares are considered accessible terrain for the players until the DM set it otherwise (any of them could be changed to unreachable terrain/obstacle)
- Once they consider the grid map as ready, the DM can share a link with their players so they can access it
- When accessing a map, the players can position their placeholder pieces at any square on the grid, unless another piece is already at that place, or the square is unreachable terrain/an obstacle
- The players can only move their respective placeholder pieces, but the DM can move any piece on the grid (following the same positioning rules, the DM cannot place pieces over each other or move them to unreachable terrain/obstacles)
- (More specifications soon...)
